# avatar
An example iOS app using Swift, table view controllers, JSON parsing, and REST

This app takes data from a JSON file, then presents that data in a Table View Controller. In this case, we are creating avatars that have a name, photo, neighborhood, sword rating, and confirmed kills. 

The file Avatar.swift contains the class to create an avatar.
